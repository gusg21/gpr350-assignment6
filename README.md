# Starting Project

Start your project by creating a **private** template from this
repository: <https://github.com/GPR-350-101/assignment6>. Remember to:

1.  Make your repository **private**
2.  Add me as a collaborator
3.  There are no unit tests, so no need to set GitHub secrets


# Goal

Optimize assignment 4 (or 5) using spatial partitions.


# Grading

Grades will be based on the criteria in the PDF. Particles colliding between them and with the 4/6 planes is required. Only the particle-particle collisions will be filtered by the spatial partitions. The grading is on 30 points. NO ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR CREATIVITY.

Here are the rules in the PDF on Canvas :
1. Follows submission criteria – 2 points
2. Game follows the rules – 8 points
3. Implementation of the technique – 15 points
4. Discernable difference in number of collision checks – 5 points
Extra credit – use a second technique and use the “T” key to cycle through all techniques (including none) +5 points
